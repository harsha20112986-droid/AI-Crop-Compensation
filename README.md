# AI-Crop-Compensation

AI Crop Compensation System:


An AI-powered, multilingual platform that bridges the gap between farmers and government compensation schemes during climate-related crop losses.
The system uses real-time climate data to detect potential crop damage, intelligently matches farmers with eligible schemes, and instantly estimates compensation amounts. A voice-enabled AI chatbot (Telugu, English, Hindi) guides farmers step-by-step through eligibility, benefits, and application processes.
By combining AI, automation, and regional language support, the platform ensures faster awareness, reduced information barriers, and improved financial security for rural communities.


Vision: 
  Empower every farmer in Andhra Pradesh with timely, transparent, and accessible compensation support.
